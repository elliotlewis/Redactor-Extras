To use a plugin edit an existing config or create a new config json file as per Craft's [documentation](https://craftcms.com/docs/rich-text-fields#redactor-configs).

Turn on required plugins then an example config could be:

    {
        "plugins": ["scriptbuttons", "counter", "alignment"]
    }

	}

#### Word / Character count

Adds a 'Word count' button to the toolbar. Overlay modal appears with word and character count.

	{
		"plugins": ["counter"]
	}

#### Alignment

Adds an 'Alignment' button to the toolbar. Aligns text block by adding a class, `text-center` or `text-right`.

	{
		"plugins": ["alignment"]
	}

#### Properties

Assign an id or class to any block level tag. From the cursor position outwrds, finds the first block level item, eg. p, ul. and adds `id="xx" or class="xx"`. Use the HTML source plugin to view code to see this in action.

	{
		"plugins": ["properties"]
	}

#### Predefined Links

Add a list of predefined links to the link menu. These can be external or internal. Probably best to let Craft handle internal link as it spports linking to Entries and Assets.

	{
        plugins:        ["definedlinks"],
        definedLinks:   [
            { "name": "Select...", "url": "" },
            { "name": "Google", "url": "http://google.com" },
            { "name": "Home", "url": "/" },
            { "name": "About", "url": "/about/" },
            { "name": "Contact", "url": "/contact/" }
        ]
    }

#### Character Lmiter

Limits the number of character in the rich text field to the value definied in <redactor-config>.json.

    {
        "plugins": ["limiter"],
        "limiter": 20
    }

### Your own custom plugin

There's also the option to create your own Redactor plugin and link to the JS and CSS files. Just fill-in the paths in settings under, 'Custom plugin'. The plugin code needs to follow the Craft way of wrapping/loading the JS. Check the included Redactor plugins as an example.
